## 📁 Data Preparation

### Dataset Structure for Qwen-Image Training

The training data should follow the same format as Flux LoRA training, where each image has a corresponding text file with the same name:

```
dataset/
├── img1.png
├── img1.txt
├── img2.jpg
├── img2.txt
├── img3.png
├── img3.txt
└── ...
```

### Dataset Structure for Qwen-Image-Edit Training

For control-based image editing, the dataset should be organized with separate directories for target images/captions and control images:

```
dataset/
├── images/           # Target images and their captions
│   ├── image_001.jpg
│   ├── image_001.txt
│   ├── image_002.jpg
│   ├── image_002.txt
│   └── ...
└── control/          # Control images
    ├── image_001.jpg
    ├── image_002.jpg
    └── ...
```
### Data Format Requirements

1. **Images**: Support common formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP)
2. **Text files**: Plain text files containing image descriptions
3. **File naming**: Each image must have a corresponding text file with the same base name

### Example Data Structure

```
my_training_data/
├── portrait_001.png
├── portrait_001.txt
├── landscape_042.jpg
├── landscape_042.txt
├── abstract_design.png
├── abstract_design.txt
└── style_reference.jpg
└── style_reference.txt
```

### Text File Content Examples

**portrait_001.txt:**
```
A realistic portrait of a young woman with brown hair, natural lighting, professional photography style
```

**landscape_042.txt:**
```
Mountain landscape at sunset, dramatic clouds, golden hour lighting, wide angle view
```

**abstract_design.txt:**
```
Modern abstract art with geometric shapes, vibrant colors, minimalist composition
```

### Data Preparation Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Use high-resolution images (recommended 1024x1024 or higher)
2. **Description Quality**: Write detailed, accurate descriptions of your images
3. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent style and quality across your dataset
4. **Dataset Size**: For good results, use at least 10-50 image-text pairs
5. **Trigger Words**: If training on a specific concept, include consistent trigger words in descriptions
6. **Auto-generate descriptions**: You can generate image descriptions automatically using [Florence-2](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gokaygokay/Florence-2)

### Quick Data Validation

You can verify your data structure using the included validation utility:

```bash
python utils/validate_dataset.py --path path/to/your/dataset
```

This will check that:
- Each image has a corresponding text file
- All files follow the correct naming convention
- Report any missing files or inconsistencies

## 🏁 Start Training on < 24gb vram

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_lora_4090.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train_4090.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora_4090.yaml
```
![Sample Output](./assets/Valentin_24gb.jpg)


## 🏁 Start Training

### Qwen-Image LoRA Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_lora.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora.yaml
```

Make sure `train_lora.yaml` is correctly set up with paths to your dataset, model, output directory, and other parameters.


### Qwen-Image Full Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_full_qwen_image.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train_full_qwen_image.py --config ./train_configs/train_full_qwen_image.yaml
```

Make sure `train_full_qwen_image.yaml` is correctly set up with paths to your dataset, model, output directory, and other parameters.

#### Loading Trained Full Model

After training, you can load your trained model from the checkpoint directory for inference.

**Simple Example:**

```python
from diffusers import QwenImagePipeline, QwenImageTransformer2DModel, AutoencoderKLQwenImage
import torch
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
import os

def load_trained_model(checkpoint_path):
    """Load trained model from checkpoint"""
    print(f"Loading trained model from: {checkpoint_path}")
    
    # Load config to get original model path
    config_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_path, "config.yaml")
    config = OmegaConf.load(config_path)
    original_model_path = config.pretrained_model_name_or_path
    
    # Load trained transformer
    transformer_path = os.path.join(checkpoint_path, "transformer")
    transformer = QwenImageTransformer2DModel.from_pretrained(
        transformer_path,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
        low_cpu_mem_usage=True
    )
    transformer.to("cuda")
    transformer.eval()
    
    # Load VAE from original model
    vae = AutoencoderKLQwenImage.from_pretrained(
        original_model_path,
        subfolder="vae",
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
    )
    vae.to("cuda")
    vae.eval()
    
    # Create pipeline
    pipe = QwenImagePipeline.from_pretrained(
        original_model_path,
        transformer=transformer,
        vae=vae,
        torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
    )
    pipe.to("cuda")
    
    print("Model loaded successfully!")
    return pipe

# Usage
checkpoint_path = "/path/to/your/checkpoint"
pipe = load_trained_model(checkpoint_path)

# Generate image
prompt = "A beautiful landscape with mountains and lake"
image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    width=768,
    height=768,
    num_inference_steps=30,
    true_cfg_scale=5,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
)

# Save result
output_image = image.images[0]
output_image.save("generated_image.png")
```

**Complete Example Script:**

```bash
python inference_trained_model_gpu_optimized.py
```

**Checkpoint Structure:**

The trained model is saved in the following structure:
```
checkpoint/
├── config.yaml          # Training configuration
└── transformer/         # Trained transformer weights
    ├── config.json
    ├── diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.index.json
    └── diffusion_pytorch_model-00001-of-00005.safetensors
    └── ... (multiple shard files)
```


### Qwen-Image-Edit LoRA Training

For control-based image editing training, use the specialized training script:

```bash
accelerate launch train_qwen_edit_lora.py --config ./train_configs/train_lora_qwen_edit.yaml
```

#### Configuration for Qwen-Image-Edit

The configuration file `train_lora_qwen_edit.yaml` should include:

- `img_dir`: Path to target images and captions directory (e.g., `./extracted_dataset/train/images`)
- `control_dir`: Path to control images directory (e.g., `./extracted_dataset/train/control`)
- Other standard LoRA training parameters

## 🧪 Usage

### Qwen-Image-Edit Full Training

To begin training with your configuration file (e.g., `train_full_qwen_edit.yaml`), run:

```bash
accelerate launch train_full_qwen_edit.py --config ./train_configs/train_full_qwen_edit.yaml
```

```

### 🎨 Generate Image with Qwen-Image LoRA
You can find LoRA weights [here](https://huggingface.co/flymy-ai/qwen-image-realism-lora)

No trigger word required
```python
prompt = '''Super Realism portrait of a teenager woman of African descent, serene calmness, arms crossed, illuminated by dramatic studio lighting, sunlit park in the background, adorned with delicate jewelry, three-quarter view, sun-kissed skin with natural imperfections, loose shoulder-length curls, slightly squinting eyes, environmental street portrait with text "FLYMY AI" on t-shirt.'''
negative_prompt =  " "
image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=1024,
    height=1024,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=5,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(346346)
)

# Display the image (in Jupyter or save to file)
image.show()
# or
image.save("output.png")
```

### 🎨 Edit Image with Qwen-Image-Edit LoRA

```python
# Load input image
image = Image.open("/path/to/your/input/image.jpg").convert("RGB")

# Define editing prompt
prompt = "Make a shot in the same scene of the person moving further away from the camera, keeping the camera steady to maintain focus on the central subject, gradually zooming out to capture more of the surrounding environment as the figure becomes less detailed in the distance."

# Generate edited image
inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("edited_image.png")
```
